# Take home:

Above are objects in Salesforce. Design a pipeline (what tools and languages) to get it into Tableau.

Once this data is in Tableau, it will be used for analytics. The analytics are wide-ranging, from Learner grades to enrolment by Track. 
We expect to need most of this data easily accessible for Analysts that donâ€™t have SQL knowledge.

The format of this can be wide-ranging; for example, a document, powerpoint, markdown file, etc. 

You will be guaranteed an interview if you send us this file and will be expected to talk about the file at the interview.

# Time

It's important to us that you spend at least one hour on this exercise, and NO MORE than three hours. Please set a timer for 3 hours and don't
invest any additional time! This exercise is meant to be fodder for meaningful discussion with a real human, not a pass/fail or automate-able
project submission.


# Submission

Please send your submission to leith@meritamerica.org via your file-sharing service of choice (or just send it straight through email if it's not too big)

Thanks so much for your time and interest at working for Merit America! We'll be in touch soon.
